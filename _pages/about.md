I am Haoqi Li. Currently, I am an applied scientist at Amazon AWS AI.

Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California advised by Prof. <a href="https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Shrikanth Narayanan</font></a> and <a href="http://viterbi.usc.edu/academics/faculty/faculty-directory/profile.php?faculty=georgiou_panayiotis.xml"><font color="brown">Panayiotis Georgiou</font></a> in the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (<a href="https://sail.usc.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">SAIL</font></a>).

My research interests and experiences include machine/deep Learning on human speech/language related areas, including speech signal processing, speech recognition, speaker recognition, affective computing, and natural language processing.

During my PhD study, I focused on understanding and quantification of human emotions and behaviors from speech, language and vision through deep learning techniques.
